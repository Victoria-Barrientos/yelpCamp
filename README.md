ðŸš§ READ ME PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION ðŸš§

YelpCamp is the final proyect of the first web development bootcamp I attended. Its a Yelp knockoff but for sharing campground sites.

During the bootcamp I followed along my mentor's coding while:

- creating a basic node.js express app using MongoDB as a database
- creating a mongoose Schema and basic CRUD
- creating some basic express middleware and our very own simple middleware
- creating some basic styles with Bootstrap and minimal CSS manipulation
- using express' built-in error handlers, handling async errors, and differentiating mongoose errors
- validating data with npm package JOI
